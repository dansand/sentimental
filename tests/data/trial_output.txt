TITLE:    Ojibwe Child with Cancer Quits Chemo for Traditional Medicine, Needs Support
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An 11-year-old Ojibwe girl stricken with cancer has refused chemotherapy and opted to rely solely on traditional medicine instead.

Makayla Sault, who resides in the Missisaugas of the New Credit First Nation, Ontario, suffers from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. Her body is exhausted from 11 weeks of chemotherapy treatments, she explains in the YouTube video (shown below), and she is now feeling "awesome" after Six Nations traditional medicine known as "Ongwehowe Onǫhgwatri:yo:".

In her May 7 video, Makayla reads a letter to the Band Council, in which she seeks protection of her right to use indigenous medicines, and for her parents to honor her request.

"I have asked my mom and dad to take me off this treatment because I do not want to go this way anymore," Makayla says. "I am sick to my stomach all the time and I lost about 10 pounds because I couldn't keep nothing down. I know that what I have can kill me, but I don’t want to die in a hospital in chemo, weak and sick."

Video of Ojibwe child refuses chemo, wants traditional medicine instead.

Makayla is supported by her parents, Pastors Ken and Sonya Sault, who have allowed her to receive traditional medicine through a healer on Six Nations, reported The Two Row Times.

But because there is no proof of the efficacy of traditional medicine, the hospital is viewing the Sault family’s choice to abandon chemotherapy as failing to provide proper medical care for the child.

"All in all, it's a very tragic situation," Andy Koster, executive director of the Children's Aid Society of Brant, told The National Post. "We have to decide as an agency how we wish to handle this.”

The Society boasts a staff of 200 including 40 staff of Aboriginal ancestry who form the Aboriginal Services Department. Makayla's leading oncologist physician Dr. Barr also tried to convince the family not to use indigenous medicines. Makayla's mother told the Band Council that “[Dr. Barr] said to us ‘…anyone who says that traditional medicine works should be thrown in jail.’”

The New Credit First Nation Band Council has issued a letter of support to the Sault family, and both the New Credit First Nation and members of the Six Nations have asserted that they would not permit anyone to forcibly remove Makayla from the reserve.

As for Makayla, she says, "I gained some of my weight back, I'm eating and drinking and I can hold it all down, and I am getting my strength back."

TITLE:    Ojibwe Child Will Not Be Taken From Parents or Forced to Resume Chemo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eleven-year-old Makayla Sault will not be seized from her parents in Missisaugas of the New Credit First Nation, Ontario, for their allowing her to abandon chemotherapy in favor or traditional medicine, the Executive Director of the Children’s Aid Society (CAS) of Brant, Andrew Koster, said in a statement.

Makayla, Ojibwe, suffers from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. She asked her parents to quit chemotherapy after 11 weeks of treatment that left her exhausted and nauseated. She is now receiving Six Nations traditional medicine known as "Ongwehowe Onǫhgwatri:yo:" via a Six Nations healer. On May 7, Makayla released a video of her reading a letter to her Band Council requesting their support for her decision to discontinue chemotherapy and rely solely on traditional medicine to treat her cancer.

Previously, Koster called the family's decision "a very tragic situation," and added, "We have to decide as an agency how we wish to handle this."

Yesterday, Koster stated the agency is stopping its investigation of the matter, reported the Two Row Times. CAS will not apprehend Makayla and force her to resume chemotherapy.

"We do not have any intention of interfering with the family or apprehending Makayla or any of her other siblings. We respect Makayla’s choice. This is a unanimous decision from the Children’s Aid Society. We have no intention of taking this thing any further. We’ve looked at the information at this point that we have. We respect the wishes of the family, the wishes of Makayla and the wishes of the community. We will not be apprehending. We want to keep our word," Koster said at a community meeting of about 40 invited officials and dozens of supporters Tuesday afternoon.

Sally Rivers, the director of aboriginal services for the Brant CAS, noted that the agency "acknowledges and respects [indigenous] medicine," and added that she and the organization "acknowledge and honour Makayla’s choice."

Rivers also told CTV that she and her colleagues "did not feel it was … our job to force Makayla to do treatment she and her family felt was not being of benefit to her."

Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation Chief Bryan LaForme thanked Makayla's many supporters in attendance for respecting the Nation's decision to stand by the Sault family. "Chief and Council also support the decision that the family have made," he said.

At the close of the meeting, Rivers presented the Saults with a blanket and a braid of sweetgrass, and offered words of reconciliation on behalf of the Native Services Branch of the CAS, reported the Two Row Times.

TITLE:    Christie Blatchford: Is a treatment decision what Makayla Sault really needs?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If Makayla Sault, the gravely ill child who is refusing chemotherapy, is not “a child in need of protection” as a children’s aid society has recently determined, is she nonetheless a youngster in need of a treatment decision?

Barbara Kay: Save Makayla from cultural correctness Religion, medical science and the best interests of children can make a hot-potato stew. What do you do, for example, when scientifically ignorant parents believe prayers will be more efficacious than a proven medical intervention to save a critically ill child? That was the question asked and answered in the 1995 case, B(R) v. Children’s Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto, when Jehovah’s Witness parents refused a blood transfusion for their severely anemic 1-year-old daughter who was at risk of congestive heart failure. The decision was to make the baby a ward of the court in order to administer the transfusions, because it was felt that they offered the child’s best hope for survival. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately ruled that this state intervention was a legitimate limitation on religious freedom. Continue reading…

That is the agonizingly difficult question that remains unanswered.

Certainly in the result, the one body uniquely qualified to make such life-and-death decisions in Ontario — the independent Consent and Capacity Board or CCB — never had a crack at the case.

When the 11-year-old girl, a member of the New Credit First Nation near Hamilton, Ont., and her parents decided to stop chemotherapy after the first round left her so weak she had to be carried around, doctors at McMaster Children’s Hospital in Hamilton reported the matter to Brant Family and Children’s Services, as by law under the Child and Family Services Act they were obligated to do.

A team at the Brant agency, led by executive-director Andy Koster, investigated and quickly decided they would not intervene.

When Mr. Koster spoke to Postmedia earlier this week, he said out of compassion and humanity for the child and her loving parents, the agency decided to back off.

Children’s aid societies in the province regularly go to court — sometimes on an urgent basis — to seek permission to have sick or dying children receive treatment, where they or their parents refuse it.

Meanwhile, officials at the hospital said that they were legally obliged to report the matter to Brant CFS, as doctors believed she needed medical care.

In fact, seven years ago, a doctor from McMaster went to the CCB in the case of an eight-month-old infant who was in a vegetative state, but whose religious parents believed that God would eventually heal him and that he thus should have been kept alive until the miracle happened.

Similarly, in a video she made, pleading her case to be allowed to stop chemotherapy for her acute lymphoblastic leukemia and be treated by an aboriginal healer, Makayla, whose father is a pastor at the New Credit Fellowship Centre, said “I know that what I have can kill me”, but said that Jesus had come into her room one night, “told me that I am healed”, and that she had even seen “the holes” in his hands.

There are other differences between that case — called EJG — and Makayla’s.

The poor baby clearly couldn’t have made a decision about his medical care; he was far too young and too brain-damaged.

But Makayla may well have been deemed by her doctors to be perfectly capable of making her own decision; the presumption is always that people, even young ones, have the right to make their own decisions about their care if they are capable of doing so.

The hospital, bound by patient confidentiality rules, would be unable to say if this was the situation here.

In addition, the baby named EJG was still in hospital, where doctors had access to him, and Makayla is not: Thus, hospital spokeswoman Agnes Bongers said Thursday, “There was no question about whether there [was] a need for protection” from a child-welfare agency in EJG’s case.

“While there may be similarities with any case, each case also has its own distinguishing factors,” she said in an email to Postmedia. “The CCB was not a viable option.”

But absent doubts about the little girl’s capacity to make such an enormous decision, Makayla’s doctors could have taken the case directly to the CCB, whose 142 full and part-time members number among them dozens and dozens of lawyers and psychiatrists, some with specialties in ethics, as well as laymen with experience in everything from aboriginal matters to health care.

Had they done so, a quick hearing would have been guaranteed — the board is legislated to start the hearing within seven days of receiving a case and decisions must be rendered within a day after a hearing ends, even on weekends.

In addition, a CCB hearing wouldn’t have meant Makayla was wrenched from the bosom of her family and traumatized, the spectre that so haunted Mr. Koster at the Brant children’s aid.

As he put it earlier this week, “We have to bring her into care so we can force chemotherapy on her?”

What was most evident in Mr. Koster’s voice was what Mark Handelman, a former member of the CCB and now a Toronto lawyer in private practice with a specialty in health matters and bioethics, calls the “moral distress” such cases cause.

The presumption is always that people, even young ones, have the right to make their own decisions about their care if they are capable of doing so

Mr. Handelman, who left the board in 2008 after 10 years, said the little girl’s treatment team likely would have been in agony over her situation, knowing they could probably save her.

Makayla suffers from a variant of leukemia called “Philadelphia chromosome-positive”, which affects only three to five per cent of those stricken with the most common childhood cancer.

Until recently, the prognosis for these children was grim, but the advent of a new, smart bullet-type drug, in conjunction with aggressive chemo, has resulted in good outcomes for 70% of those with the variant.

That’s part of the difficulty for doctors and workers at the children’s aid: Wanting to keep the child alive, knowing her wishes and assuming she has the capacity to know the consequences, what should they do?

Adding to the miasma of doubt is that virtually nothing is known about the traditional therapy — called “Ongwehowe Onongwatri:yo:” — her family has said she’s getting from a healer at Six Nations, a reserve near her own.

Details of the treatment are considered protected knowledge, and no research on any of the practices has ever been done.

Postmedia’s requests for any information about it — from either the office of the “aboriginal patient navigators” at the hospital or from Dr. Malcolm King, head of the Institute of Aboriginal Peoples’ Health (an arm of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research) — have gone unanswered and unacknowledged.

As Mr. Handleman put it, with considerable understatement, “These are very tough questions.”

AUTHORS:  
TITLE:    Robyn Urback: Why should we protect kids like Ezekiel Stephan from alternative medicine, but not Makayla Sault?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last January, an Ontario girl died of an illness that mainstream medicine had a reasonable chance of curing. Eleven-year-old Makayla Sault had been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia — which has a 70 to 80 per cent or higher survival rate, according to doctors — but had chosen, along with her parents, to discontinue chemotherapy and opt instead for traditional native medicine and other alternative therapies. Makayla claimed at the time that the chemo was “killing her body,” and said that she had seen a vision of Jesus, who told her she would be cured. Doctors warned that there was a 100 per cent chance that Makayla would relapse if she didn’t continue with chemotherapy, but Makayla’s mother was confident that the alternative therapies would work. “There are people in our community who have been on traditional medicines and are well today and are thriving,” she said. “We know that our traditional medicines work. We know that our daughter is going to be OK.” Makayla died on Jan. 19.

In March 2012, an Alberta boy died of an illness that mainstream medicine also has a reasonable chance of curing. Nineteen-month-old Ezekiel Stephan had bacterial meningitis, which has a survival rate of around 90 per cent if caught and treated early enough. His parents, however, didn’t take him to a doctor, and instead treated what they thought was croup with natural remedies, including olive leaf extract, garlic, hot peppers and horseradish. When Ezekiel’s condition worsened — his body was so stiff he couldn’t sit in a car seat and he was being fed liquids via an eyedropper — his parents took him to a naturopath instead of a medical doctor, even after they were advised that he could have meningitis. They continued treating him with natural remedies and a supplement called BLAST, until Ezekiel stopped breathing and the Stephans finally decided to call 911. Ezekiel died that same month.

Both sets of parents say they should be free to choose alternative therapies for their children, but only one is facing up to five years behind bars

Following their children’s deaths, both sets of parents have been remarkably defiant in their insistence that they were doing the right thing. Makayla’s parents blamed her death on the chemotherapy she received early in her treatment, saying in a statement that it “did irreversible damage to her heart and major organs.” Ezekiel’s parents, who were found guilty by a jury this week of failing to provide the necessities of life, say they are being unfairly targeted by the Canadian justice system, which is offering their “family up on the sacrificial altar of the vaccine industry.” Both sets of parents say they should be free to choose alternative therapies for their children, but only one is facing up to five years behind bars.

In November 2014, an Ontario court ruled on a case markedly similar to Makayla’s, saying that an Ontario hospital could not force an 11-year-old (whose name was protected by a publication ban) with cancer to undergo mainstream medical treatment, and that it was her mother’s “aboriginal right” to pursue traditional medicine for her daughter. The decision was astounding in that it seemed a virtual death sentence for any critically ill First Nations child whose parents might choose to shun mainstream medicine. The judge offered a “clarification” six-months later — after Makayla’s death, and at which point the 11-year-old at the centre of the case had resumed chemotherapy — saying that the “use [of] traditional medicines must remain consistent with the principle that the best interests of the children remain paramount,” which in many ways leaves the question of justice in these situations as ambiguous as ever.

The big difference between the cases of Makayla Sault and Ezekiel Stephan was that Makayla was old enough to offer her input on her own medical care, whereas Ezekiel was helpless and totally dependent on his parents to get him the treatment he needed. Nevertheless, it is fair to wonder — and perhaps to believe — that if both children were born at another time, or to different parents, that they wouldn’t be made to suffer preventable deaths: Makayla might not have suffered a stroke at 11 years old; Ezekiel’s lungs might’ve not have filled with pus as his body painfully froze in position.

Arguably, both children died because their parents opted for alternative treatments instead of proven science: that one alternative treatment had “aboriginal” in its name does not make it any more credible. The Canadian justice system is in the process of ensuring that children like Ezekiel — those born to non-aboriginal parents — won’t suffer as he did. It should do the same for children like Makayla.

AUTHORS:  
TITLE:    Terry Glavin: Makayla’s death, but our disgrace
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because it cannot be put to any grand or cheap political purpose, the one true thing you’re unlikely to hear spoken loudly and plainly about the unnecessary death of 11-year-old leukemia victim Makayla Sault on Monday is that, in all probability, if she’d been a white girl, she’d still be alive.

It is certainly conceivable that if Makayla had not been a child of the Mississaugas of Port Credit, she’d have died anyway.

Christie Blatchford: Lest you imagine the death of Makayla Sault will galvanize someone, somewhere, give your head a shake Makayla Sault, the little girl from the New Credit First Nation near Brantford, Ont., who stopped chemotherapy, was by all accounts a lovely kid, smart and brave, and now she is dead, at 11. J.J., another little girl whose name is protected by a court publication ban, is also 11 and aboriginal, from the Six Nations reserve not far from Makayla’s reserve. But lest you imagine that the death of the first little girl will galvanize someone, somewhere, to action in the case of the second, give your head a shake, please. J.J. has the same cancer Makayla had — acute lymphoblastic leukemia — though the cure rate for hers is about 90%, probably because Makayla had a rare version called Philadelphia chromosome positive which made her prognosis less rosy. Continue reading…

Ontario’s Health Care Consent Act allows all children to determine their own medical treatment, so long as their capacity for judgement is sufficient to appreciate “the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of decision.” When Makayla ended her chemotherapy treatments last May, she said it was because Jesus visited her in hospital and told her she was already healed. Makayla’s parents, in the throes of emotional agony at the time, are evangelical Christian pastors. Unsurprisingly, they deferred to the judgement of their child.

This doesn’t exactly leap from the public record as evidence of reasonable reflection upon the foreseeable life-and-death consequences of the decision Makayla was being expected to make. Everything that McMaster Hospital had explained to the Sault family about the Maykala’s leukemia came down to the horrifying fact that it is known to be curable only by chemotherapy treatment, and without treatment death is all but certain.

But what ultimately mattered was the claim to an aboriginal identity that everybody was making on Makayla’s behalf.

It was the thing that mattered to the Children’s Aid Society of Brant, bound by the obligations set out in its 19-page policy on Diversity and Anti-Oppressive Practice. It was what mattered to New Credit Chief Bryan LaForme, who warned that hundreds of community members in the “Makayla Defence Force” would spring to action should the Children’s Aid Society attempt an apprehension.

It was what mattered after Makayla announced her visitation from Jesus and Children’s Aid Society executive director Andrew Koster closed the family’s case file, because “their choice to use traditional medicines was within their right.” It was what mattered after Makayla’s death this week, when Koster declared that by refusing treatment Makayla had acted in accordance with Ontario law and “eloquently exercised her indigenous rights as a First Nations person.”

Just how aboriginal rights should matter to any of this in the first place is something that beggars belief. No light on the subject was shed last November in a court decision that also involved McMaster Hospital and Brant child protection authorities and another 11-year-old aboriginal girl afflicted by a similarly lethal case of leukemia. That other girl is a Six Nations band member known publicly only as “J.J.”, owing to a ban on revealing her identity ordered by the Ontario Court of Justice.

What was clear enough about Judge Gethin Edward’s decision in J.J.’s case was his finding that a contemporary First Nations family’s resort to traditional aboriginal medicine is comprehensible as an aboriginal right protected by Section 35 of the Constitution. This aspect of his decision should have been unsurprising, heartening and uncontroversial.

But what was never made plain was how it necessarily follows that J.J.’s mother was entitled by right to withdraw J.J. from life-saving chemotherapy. That was the crux of Judge Edward’s decision. For it to make sense, you’d have to believe that “modern” and “traditional” treatment could not co-exist in J.J.’s life, which is nonsense.

Even stranger, Judge Edward’s written ruling is unburdened by the wisdom at the very heart of the only higher-court aboriginal rights decision he relied upon, the Supreme Court of Canada’s 1996 aboriginal fishing rights decision in R. v. Van der Peet: “Any right, aboriginal or other, by its very nature carries with it the obligation to use it responsibly. It cannot be used, for example, in a way which harms people, aboriginal or non‑aboriginal.”

The law may well be an ass, but it isn’t such an ass that Section 35 of the Constitution should be expected to recognize and affirm the right of J.J.’s parents to deny their child the only known cure for the disease that’s killing her. It’s not such an ass as to provide a constitutional entitlement to the aromatherapy, wheatgrass enemas, acupuncture and naturopathic massage sessions offered to cancer sufferers at $18,000 a customer by the dizzy white people at the notorious Hippocrates Health Institute of West Palm Beach, Florida.

This New Age wellness emporium, which even several of its former employees are now suing on the grounds that the whole operation is a “scam”, is where J.J. was taken by her parents after leaving McMaster Hospital. It is also where Makayla Sault was taken by her parents in their pursuit of “alternative” treatments.

The proximate cause of Makayla’s death on Monday was a stroke. Oncologists will tell you a stroke is commonly the cause of death among leukemia victims left untreated by chemotherapy. Makayla’s grieving parents say we should believe instead that the stroke was a consequence of those initial, excruciating chemotherapy treatments that Makayla decided to bring to an end last year.

We’re also expected to believe that J.J. remains in good health. This is at least somewhat believable, given what science explains about the time leukemia can take to eventually kill its victims. But we are expected to simply believe quite a lot of things about Makayla’s story. Like the one about it amounting to some eloquent expression of aboriginal identity.

Don’t believe a word of it.

When a young aboriginal girl dies a public death in Canada these days the narrative of first resort tends to be the tragedy of Canada’s “missing and murdered aboriginal women,” whose names number more than 1,000 from the past 30 years or so. Makayla wasn’t murdered, but something more than hair-splitting should be required to make you believe that Makayla Sault’s name does not belong on that dreadful death list.

Makayla’s case is exceptional mainly in the way the Canadian state is directly implicated in the decisions that led to her death. First Nation administrations are creatures of the federal Indian Act, the Brant Children’s Aid Society is a function of the Ontario Ministry of Children and Youth Services, and so on.

It is to Canada’s disgrace that Makayla’s story is also unexceptional in only one reasonably believable way.

In all likelihood, had she not been an aboriginal girl, she would not be dead.
